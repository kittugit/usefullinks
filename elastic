Curl:
Indices:
    Delete all: curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_all
    
Cluster:
  Health: curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
  Stats: curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/stats?pretty

Disk Allocation:  curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/allocation?v

Unassigned Shards:

Reason for Unassigned Shards: curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,state,unassigned.reason' | grep UNASSIGNED
Delete Unassinged Shards: 
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards?v  2>/dev/null |grep UNASSIGNED | sed -e 's/\([^ ]*\) *\([^ ]*\) *.*/\1 \2/'|while read line; do indexname=`echo $line|cut -d' ' -f1`; curl -X PUT localhost:9200/$indexname/_settings -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d'
{
    "index.number_of_replicas": 0
}'; done

Set number of replicas for an index: 

curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards?v  2>/dev/null |grep UNASSIGNED | sed -e 's/\([^ ]*\) *\([^ ]*\) *.*/\1 \2/'|while read line; do indexname=`echo $line|cut -d' ' -f1`; curl -X PUT localhost:9200/$indexname/_settings -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d'
{
   "settings": {
        "index.number_of_replicas": 0
    }
}'; done

Delete Index with Unassigned Shards: curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards | grep UNASSIGNED | awk {'print $1'} | xargs -i curl -XDELETE "http://localhost:9200/{}"

Explain: (Unassigned shards cluster_recovered) 
  curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/allocation/explain?pretty'


Stop Reallocation:

# run before stopping an elasticsearch instance
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"transient" : {"cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "primaries" } } 

# run after elasticsearch is restarted and elasticsearch box is completed
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"transient" : {"cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "all" } }
